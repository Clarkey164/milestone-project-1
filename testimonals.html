                    John and Ste turned up on time and where professional through the entire time they worked on my car. I opted for the Showroom Clean
                    as the car hadn't been cleaned in a long time and had a musky smell due to my son's football, so I wanted the car to feel new and clean again. 
                    The lads kept me informed on what the plan was for the car from start to finish and ensure I was happy with eveything they did, which I was. 
                    I couldn't recommend a better team to get your car looking and feeling brand new. Thanks Lads!

                        Having had my car for well over 3 years it was time for a change and having a new deal agreed I wanted to make sure my old was spic and span before
                        the trade in. Major Cleans offer a great price and perfect package for what I needed. As I was trading the car in the interior was the priority, the wax 
                        sealent would have been nice but as I was trading the car in I didn't need it this timen around but having seen the quality of the work 
                        Ste and John offer I will be back in touch soon. Couldn't recommend enough!
