                        Major Cleans was founded by John, a lad with a passion for cars. Working as a mechanic from a young age he always 
                        wanted to work with cars. Have noticed the lack of mobile valet providers in the Liverpool area Major Cleans was born.
                        Having had a successful first year running Major Cleans John decided it was time to grow, a couple of beers and long disscussion later he had
                        enlisted life long friend Ste to come on board and run the business together!
